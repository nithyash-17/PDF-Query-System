        "text": "1 Experiments Using Geiger-Müller\nCounter\nDetectors are the most essential and important constituent s of all nuclear radiation count-\ning systems. In common laboratory experiments generally ra dioactive sources are used as a\nsource of radiations on which measurements are conducted. D uring disintegration, radioac-\ntive sources emit α-,β- andγ- radiations and also x-rays through secondary processes. T he\nα- andβ- radiations are charged particles while x- and γ-rays are photons. These radiations\nare detected in experiments from which information on their energies, intensities, etc. are\nobtained. Thus, a detector should be able to count particles and quanta one by one as they\nare incident on it.\nFundamentally, the process of detection proceeds through i nteraction of a given type of\nradiation with the material medium which constitutes the ac tive volume of the detector. A\ndetector can be made from either a gas, a liquid or a solid to se rve as the active medium. In\nthe following section we will discuss only about gas detecto rs. The most common gas based\ndetectors are ionisation chambers, proportional and Geige r-Müller (G.M.) counters.\n1.1 Geiger-Müller Counter\nA G.M. counter is an example of a gas based counter. It is based on ionisations produced\nby a charged/uncharged energetic particle in matter. Charg ed particles such as α,β, etc.,\ndirectly ionise the gas used to ﬁll up the counter volume. Radi ations like x- and γ-rays\nproduce secondary electrons which in turn produce ionisati on.\nAn ionising particle, while passing through the gas in the co unter, collides with the gas atoms\nproducing ionisation in its wake. If the volume of the gas is a dequately large, the particle\nwill go on losing its energy by producing ions and eventually come to a stop within that\nvolume. On an average ≃30 eV is spent per ionisation event. Thus one ionising nuclea r\nparticle leaves behind a number of ion pairs called the prima ry ions. Since the process of\nion production becomes complete in a short time of a few micro seconds, a burst of both\npositive and negative charges is generated. These charges a re swept away by an applied\nelectric ﬁeld, and get collected on the respective electrod es. Each burst, if measured by a\nsuitable instrument, will count the particle.\nIn a most common type of gas-ﬁlled counter, there is a cylindr ical cathode (1 - 2 cm diameter)\nand an axial anode made from a ﬁne tungsten wire (15 - 100 µm in diameter) as shown in\nFig. 1.1. Generally, it is ﬁlled up with a noble gas (say, argo n) at nearly 100 Torr pressure.\n1"

Alternati vely, a negative voltage could be\napplied to the cathode and the anode grounded via R2.\nA charged particle, on entering the counter, ionises the gas atoms to produce, along its path,\nas many electrons as positive ions. The number of them, thoug h statistical in nature, is\ndetermined by the quantity of energy the incident particle d eposits within the counter. The\nelectrons created by ionisation in the gaseous medium then m ove towards the anode wire\nwhile the positive ions towards the cathode.

For convenience of discussion these curves are broadly\ndivided into ﬁve regions marked in Fig. 1.3 by dashed vertica l lines. Note that the positions\nof these boundary lines are approximate since the curves do n ot show any sharp change in\nslope across them. It is assumed that all the particles dissi pate their entire energy within\nthe counter volume.\nRegion A : (U= 0 to U1Volts)\nAt very low voltages a number of the primary ions formed readi ly recombine with the elec-\ntrons since they are not capable of gaining suﬃcient energy f rom the ﬁeld to avert recom-\nbination. The amount of charge Qcollected on Cis thus less than that carried by all the\nprimary ion pairs together. However, Qincreases with Uas more and more ion pairs are\ncollected at respective electrodes..\nRegion B : ( U1< U < U 2), Q is same for incident radiation of any given energy\nIn this region, the primary ions and electrons acquire just e nough energy to avoid recombi-\nnation. Hence, all of them can now move up to the respective el ectrode to deposit the entire\ncharge generated during formation of primary ions on capaci torC. Such a condition prevails\nin an ionisation chamber and accordingly, the region B is cal led the ionisation chamber re-\ngion. In a typical case, a 5 MeV α-particle will produce an output pulse amplitude V ∼0.5\nmV on a total output capacity of 100 pF.\nRegion C : ( U2< U < U 3, Q increases rapidly with U)\nAs the applied potential Uis increased to move into this region, a new phenomenon start s.\nThe primary ions now acquire enough energy (particularly ne ar the anode wire where the\nelectric ﬁeld is high) between successive collisions with t he gas atoms to initiate fresh ion-\nisation. The secondary ions so formed will also, in their tur n, take part in the process to\neventually build up a large number of ion pairs. This is thus a n internal ion multiplication\nprocess which is strongly dependent on the applied potentia lU. The number of times the\nions get multiplied is called the gas multiplication factor m. The value of mmay be as large\nas 104. Furthermore, in this region the factor mis proportional to U. Hence, for a given\nUin this region, the pulse amplitude delivered at the anode of the counter is proportional\nto the number of primary ions, i.e., on the energy of the incid ent particle. The region Cis\nknown as the proportional region and a counter operated in th is region is called a propor-\ntional counter. For higher energy particle, the number of pr imary ions is larger. Hence the\ncurve for E= 2MeV lies above the E= 1MeV in Fig. 1.3 for the regions BandC.\nFrom the above discussion we ﬁnd that a counter operated in ei therBorCregion behaves as\na proportional device which not only detects nuclear radiat ions but also enables measurement\nof their energies. However, in laboratory experiments a pro portional counter is favoured\nover a ionisation chamber because they are capable of delive ring much larger pulses (for\nan incident α-particle of energy 5 MeV, output pulse of one Volt or so in amp litude is not\ndiﬃcult to obtain). Note that a large pulse can be processed a nd recorded more easily than\na smaller one.\nRegion D ( U3< U < U 4, Q increases with U disproportionately for the incident\nparticles of diﬀerent energies)\n4"

        "text": "1.1 Geiger-Müller Counter\nThis region is called a region of limited proportionality. H ere, the multiplication factor\nmprogressively loses its proportional behaviour as Uis increased and, hence, a counter\noperated in this region is not suitable for energy measureme nt. AtU=U4,Qbecomes\nsame for all incident energies and types of particle.\nRegion E ( U > U4, Q is very large and same and independent of radiation type\nand energy)\nAt anyUin this region, the ions acquire large energy such that gas mu ltiplication advances\nto a stage of avalanche formation even if a single primary ion pair is formed. The values\nofmshoots up to ∼109and neither the type nor the energy of the incident particle h as\nany bearing on the size of the charge pulse ( Q) produced at the output electrode. The ions\nand electrons in such circumstance spread quickly all along the anode wire and thoroughly\nsurround it. The electrons are then collected at the anode wi thin a short time while the\nions, as usual, have started moving towards the cathode cyli nder. The region is known as\nthe Geiger region and a counter operated in this region is cal led a Geiger Müller or simply\na G.M. counter.\nObviously in this case, pulses obtained from a G.M. counter i s quite large (several Volts)\nand have identical shape and amplitude for incident radiati ons (particles and photons) of\nall descriptions and energies. A G.M. counter can therefore be used only to detect and\ncount radiation but is neither suitable for use in particle i dentiﬁcation nor in measuring\ntheir energies.\n1.1.2 Quenching of discharge in a G.M. counter\nThe course of events that lead to production of a pulse in a G.M . counter do not appear\nto be as simple as the above picture describes it. The electro ns produced in the avalanche\ncreated in the vicinity of the anode wire, get collected in ∼1µs while the ions, being about\n100 times less mobile, stay around the central wire in the for m of a positive charge sheath\nfor some-time. This sheath reduces the ﬁeld around the wire a nd causes the avalanche to\nstop. As the ions reach near the cathode (in ∼10-4sec) they pull electrons from there to\nbecome neutral. The resulting gas molecules, are consequen tly raised to excited states which\ndeexcite shortly thereafter by emission of radiation. Ther e will always be some ultraviolet\ncontent in these radiations causing photoelectric emissio n from the cathode surface. These\nphotoelectrons initiate a fresh avalanche process. The sam e sequence of events repeats to give\nrise to recurrent avalanches leading to production of a chai n of pulses, a situation resembling\nthat created by a continuous discharge in the counter. Such a situation is undesirable and\nthe sequence of avalanche has to be stopped after the ﬁrst one . The process by employing\nwhich the entire event is kept restrained to only one avalanc he formation per incident particle\nfollowing formation of the primary ions is known as quenching .\nQuenching can be achieved in two ways. The external nonself- quenching technique requires\na circuit arrangement which momentarily reduces the potent ial applied to the anode imme-\ndiately after arrival of the ﬁrst avalanche of electrons on i t. As a result the electric ﬁeld\nreduces to a value too low for formation of a second avalanche . In practice this technique is\nnot useful and therefore, it will not be discussed further.\n5"

        "text": "1 Experiments Using Geiger-Müller Counter\nTo implement self-quenching in a G.M. counter it is ﬁlled up w ith a mixture of 90% argon\n(argon, a noble gas, is most commonly used) and 10% dehydrate d vapour of ethyl alcohol or\nany other suitable polyatomic organic vapour. No external q uenching circuit is necessary in\nthis case. This organic vapour serves as the quenching agent .\nIn such a counter, both argon and alcohol molecules take part in avalanche formation and,\nhence, the positive ion cloud contains both kinds of ions. Th e ionisation potential of argon\nis 15.7 eV whereas that of alcohol is 11.3 eV. As these two kind s of ions move towards\nthe cathode they collide with each other. The higher ionisat ion potential of argon makes\nit possible for its ions to become neutral atoms by extractin g electrons from the alcohol\nmolecules. The reverse can not take place. Again the ions may suﬀer as many as 105\ncollisions before reaching the cathode surface. Hence, the ion cloud reaching the cathode\nalmost entirely contains alcohol ions.\nThese alcohol ions will now pull electrons from the cathode s urface to become neutral and in\ndoing so many of them will acquire some energy. Since large po lyatomic organic molecules\nof alcohol favour dissociation to excitation, this excess e nergy does not take the polyatomic\nmolecule to an excited state but causes its dissociation int o simpler ones. No UV or other\nradiations are emitted in the process and hence a second aval anche mechanism can not start.\nIn other words, the discharge is quenched. Initially there a re about 1020alcohol molecules\nin a counter and in each avalanche 1010get dissociated, i.e., spent up. Thus the useful life\nof a G.M. counter is about 1010counts.\nWe have another point to consider. An energy excess of 4.4 eV ( =15.7-11.3, released when\nan Ar−atom neutralizes itself) is radiated as UV light which is lik ely to initiate a second\navalanche. However, alcohol or similar polyatomic molecul es have a strong absorption band\nin the same wavelength region where the UV light is absorbed c ausing dissociation of the\nmolecule rather than excitation and a second avalanche can n ot start.\nHalogens can also be used as quenching gases. Of them chlorin e and bromine have been\nfound to be most suitable. The diatomic molecules of a haloge n dissociate as in the case\nof alcohol into atoms to make quenching eﬀective. But unlike alcohol, the atoms recombine\nto form back the molecules again. As a result the quenching ga s is not consumed and the\ncounter has a virtually unlimited life.\n1.1.3 Characteristics of a G.M. counter\nA counter meant to be operated in the G.M. region (region E, al so see Fig. 1.3) is generally\nﬁlled up with a mixture of Argon gas and alcohol vapour to part ial pressures of ∼9cm\nand 1 cm of Hg at room temperature, respectively. A typical ch aracteristic curve presented\nin Fig. 1.4 shows the operating characteristics of such a cou nter.\nBefore we discuss the nature of this characteristic curve, w e should remember that some\nelectronic instrument assembly has to be used with the count er to count its pulses. These\ninstrument assembly has an inherent threshold bias which a c ounter pulse has to overcome\nin order to be recognized and registered as a count. The count er setup begins to register\ncounts when a potential UThcalled the G.M. counter threshold potential is applied.

This\nis also called the Geiger region (G.M. region) discussed ear lier. The applied voltage at\nwhich this region starts ( UTh)in Fig. 1.4) is the Geiger threshold. The constancy of count\nrate over the plateau is advantageous because the count rate is almost independent of the\napplied voltage U. The region shows a slightly upward slope with increase in U. The reason\npossibly lies in the occurrence of occasional secondary unq uenched discharges in the tube as\nUis increased. The counter operated at U>U2produces continuous discharge for which it\nis rendered unsuitable for use as a counter for detecting any incident radiation.\nThe output pulse amplitude obtained from the counter operat ed in the G.M. region is de-\ntermined by the diﬀerence (U op-UTh). To achieve a condition of noncritical operation a\nlong plateau is obviously desirable. The slope of plateau re mains within 1% per 100 volts of\napplied potential. The length and slope of the plateau depen d on the nature of the ﬁlling\ngas, the condition of the anode wire and the condition of the c ylinder surface.\nAlthough all G.M. counters work on the same basic principle, their constructions are diﬀer-\nent. A counter has to be trimmed to suit the application for wh ich it is meant. A G.M.\ncounter intended to detect β-particles has to have a thin entrance window to admit low\nenergyβ-particles. A 1 mg cm-2thick mylar window admits all electrons of energy > 20 keV\ninto the counter volume. In these counters, it is convenient to ﬁx the window at one end\nwhen it is called an end-window counter (Fig. 1.5). For detec tingγ-rays on the other hand,\na much thicker window can be tolerated except when detection of very low energy γ-rays\nis concerned. In this case, the size of the counter need be mad e large enough so that the\nγ-rays can undergo adequate number of interactions in the ava ilable counter volume. These\ncounters can be both end-window as well as common types.\n7"

The strict deﬁnition of the dead time of th e Geiger counter is the time\nfrom initial response to a detected event until the detector can exhibit the earliest response\nto a subsequent event. But, the electronics processing the G eiger tube output pulses has a\nﬁxed voltage threshold that the pulses must exceed to be coun ted. Thus, the resolving time\nincludes the previously deﬁned dead time, but adds the time i t takes for subsequent pulses\nto recover to a suﬃcient amplitude to cross the discriminato r threshold and be counted.\nIn practice, the distinction between dead time and resolvin g time is often blurred, and the\nresolving time is frequently labeled as the dead time. That i s a pragmatically empirical\nconvention, because the measurement of counting rate is alw ays made after the supporting\nelectronics has added its contribution to the dead time.\nThe large dead time of the Geiger counter distorts the measur ed counting rate for counting\nrates above 5000 counts/minute. Thus, it is usually necessa ry to make a dead-time correction\nto obtain the true counting rate. Usually, the measurement o f the dead time is accomplished\nwith a split source. However, since we do not have split sourc e in the lab, we will use two\ncircular disk sources for the same purpose.\n15"

The fundamental assumptions of the mo dels are illustrated in Fig.\n1.12. Six randomly spaced events are shown at the middle part of the ﬁgure. At the lower\npart of the ﬁgure the dead time behavior of a detector is shown within the non-paralyzable\nmodel. A ﬁxed time interval τis assumed to follow each true event. The true events\nthat occurs during the dead period of the detector are lost an d the detector would record\nfour counts from the six true events. In contrast, the behavi or of a paralyzable detector is\nshown at the upper panel of Fig. 1.12. The same dead time τis assumed to follow each\ntrue interaction. In this case also the true events that occu r during the dead period of the\ndetector are not recorded as counts. However, the dead time i s extended by another period\nτfollowing the lost event. In the example, only three counts a re recorded for the six true\nevents.\nThe losses predicted by the above two models are nearly same a nd diﬀer only when true event\nrates are high. These models presents two extremes of ideali zed system behavior, and real\ncounting systems will often display a behavior that is inter mediate between these extremes.\nThe dead time contributed by the Geiger counter is reasonabl y accurately modeled as a\nnon-paralyzable dead time. The measured counting rate, R, is related to the true counting\nrate,r, at the input to the detector\nR=r\n1+r.Td(1.1)\nHere,Tdis the dead time caused by each quantum of radiation that is de tected when the\ncounter is free to accept a new event. Note that the dead time r educes the measured counting\nrate relative to the true counting rate, and higher counting rates cause a greater relative\nreduction.\nIn practice, the experimenter only has access to the measure d counting rate, R, after dead\ntime losses have occurred. Consequently, it is important to calculate the true counting rate,\n16"

Using equation 1.1, we can write the\ntrue counting rate from the measured counting rate and the kn own dead time per pulse.\nr=R\n1−R.Td(1.2)\nAnother useful way to express the information in equations 1 .1 and 1.2 is the percent dead\ntime loss:\nPercent Dead Time =r−R\nr×100% =R.Td×100% =r.Td\n1+r.Td×100% (1.3)\nOne way to measure the dead time per pulse, Td, would be to observe the output of the GM\ncounter on the oscilloscope and determine the minimum spaci ng between the leading edges\nof two successive pulses (See Experiment in 1.2.2). Because the arrival times of the pulses\nare randomly distributed in time, this method requires a fai rly high counting rate to make\nit easy to ﬁnd the minimum pulse spacing.\nThe double source method is another technique to measure the dead time of GM counter.\nUsually, a split source, a circular disk source splitted int o two half, is used in the measurement\nprocess. However, due to unavailiblity of the source we will follow the process using two\ncircular radioactive sources.\nFirst, place the two sources side by side so that both the sour ces are equally visible by the GM\ncounter. Adjust the distance between the source and the coun ter to achieve a percent dead\ntime in the range of 10% to 20%. For a 100- µsdead time, this implies measured counting\nrates in the range of 1,000 to 2,000 counts/s, or 60,000 to 120 ,000 counts per minute.\nNext, one the source (ﬁrst) is removed, and the counting rate of the other one, R2, is\nmeasured. Subsequently, the ﬁrst one is carefully reinstal led without disturbing the second\nsource, and the counting rate from the pair of sources, R12, is measured. Finally, the second\nsource disk is removed without disturbing the ﬁrst source, a nd the counting rate, R1, is\nmeasured. R1,R2, andR12can be inserted into equation 1.2 to write the equations for r1,\nr2, andr12, respectively. Because of the dead time, R12<(R1+R2). But for the true\ncounting rates\nr12=r1+r2 (1.4)\nCombining equation 1.4 with the expressions for r1,r2andr12from equation 1.2, permits\nsolving for Tdin terms of the measured counting rates.

As a result, it\ngradually slows down till it comes to rest. In other words, it is ﬁnally absorbed. An electron\nhaving an incident kinetic energy of 1 MeV suﬀers more than 104collisions in an absorber\nbefore being stopped.\nAn electron gives away its energy through various interacti ons with the atoms and nuclei\nconstituting the absorber. The most predominant one is coul omb interaction. The radiative\nprocess, although of somewhat less signiﬁcance, is also a ca use of energy loss by fast electrons\nin matter.\nIn our experiment, we are concerned with β−-particles which have a distribution in energy.\nThe end-point energy Emax\nβof 2 MeV is about the highest energy we have to deal with in\nthe laboratory.\nIonisation and excitation are the most important outcome of coulomb interaction between\nβ−-particles and atomic electrons. The ejected electron and t he optical radiation emitted\non excitation are also absorbed within a short distance in th e same material. In eﬀect, an\nincidentβ−- particle ﬁnally loses its entire energy and is absorbed.\nThe speciﬁc energy loss (loss of energy per unit path length) due to collision inducing ionisa-\ntion and excitation of the atoms by fast electrons ( β−-particles emitted from our laboratory\nsources are fast electrons) is given by Bethe-Bloch equatio n:\n−/parenleftbiggdE\ndX/parenrightbigg\nc=2πe4NZ\nm0v2/bracketleftbigg\nlnm0v2E\n2I2(1−β2)−ln2/parenleftBig\n2/radicalbig\n1−β2−1+β2/parenrightBig\n+\n/parenleftbig\n1−β2/parenrightbig\n+1\n8/parenleftBig\n1−/radicalbig\n1−β2/parenrightBig2/bracketrightbigg\n,\nwheree= electronic charge, β=v/c,N= number of atoms per cm3in the absorber,\nZ= atomic number of the element constituting the absorber, m0= electron mass, c=\nvelocity of light in vacuum, E= kinetic energy of the incident electron and I= average\n40"

Therefore, the\nspace between the absorber tray and the GM counter should be s uﬃcient enough to\naccommodate the three rings of absorber.\nThe absorber foil should be placed as near to the counter as po ssible. This is necessary\nbecause some of the β−particles, while passing through the absorber, not only los e\nenergy but also get scattered to a wide angle. With the absorbe r placed away form\nthe counter but near the source, some of the particles will be scattered away from the\ncounter and thus be lost, resulting in some loss in counts. Th is will falsely add to true\nabsorption.\n5. Next, place the absorber having the least thickness on the tray and insert it in position.\nRecord counts for 1 min.\n6. Repeat step 5 with absorbers of increasing thickness “one b y one” till a thickness is\nreached when all the particles are absorbed.

In the photoelect ric absorption process, the\ngamma ray loses all of its energy in one interaction. The prob ability for this process depends\nvery strongly on gamma-ray energy Eγand atomic number Z. In Compton scattering, the\ngamma ray loses only part of its energy in one interaction. Th e probability for this process\nis weakly dependent on Eγand Z. The gamma ray can lose all of its energy in one pair-\nproduction interaction. However, this process is relative ly unimportant for our studies since\nit has a threshold above 1.02 MeV.\n1.1.1 Photoelectric Absorption\nA gamma ray may interact with a bound atomic electron in such a way that it loses all of\nits energy and ceases to exist as a gamma ray. Some of the gamma -ray energy is used to\novercome the electron binding energy, and most of the remain der is transferred to the freed\nelectron as kinetic energy. A very small amount of recoil ene rgy remains with the atom\nto conserve momentum. This is called photoelectric absorpt ion. Photoelectric absorption\nis important for gamma-ray detection because the gamma ray g ives up all its energy, and\nthe resulting pulse falls in the full-energy peak. The proba bility of photoelectric absorption\ndepends on the gamma-ray energy, the electron binding energ y, and the atomic number of the\natom. The probability is greater the more tightly bound the e lectron; therefore, K electrons\nare most aﬀected (over 80% of the interactions involve K elec trons), provided the gamma-ray\nenergy exceeds the K-electron binding energy.

Each dynode is biased to a higher volta ge than the preceding dynode by\na high voltage supply and resistive biasing ladder in the pho tomultiplier tube base. Because\nthe ﬁrst dynode is biased at a considerably more positive vol tage than the photocathode, the\nphotoelectrons are accelerated to the ﬁrst dynode. As each e lectron strikes the ﬁrst dynode\nthe electron has acquired suﬃcient kinetic energy to knock o ut 8 to 10 secondary electrons.\nThus, the dynode multiplies the number of electrons in the pu lse of charge. The secondary\nelectrons from each dynode are attracted to the next dynode b y the more positive voltage on\nthe next dynode. This multiplication process is repeated at each dynode, until the output of\nthe last dynode is collected at the anode. By the time the aval anche of charge arrives at the\nanode, the number of electrons has been multiplied by a facto r ranging from 106to108, with\nhigher applied voltages yielding larger multiplication fa ctors. For the selected bias voltage,\nthe charge arriving at the anode is proportional to the energ y deposited by the gamma ray\nin the scintillator.\nThe preampliﬁer collects the charge from the anode on a capac itor, turning the charge into\na voltage pulse. Subsequently, it transmits the voltage pul se over the long distance to the\nsupporting ampliﬁer. At the output of the preampliﬁer and at the output of the linear\nampliﬁer, the pulse height is proportional to the energy dep osited in the scintillator by\nthe detected gamma ray. The Multichannel Analyzer (MCA) mea sures the pulse heights\ndelivered by the ampliﬁer, and sorts them into a histogram to record the energy spectrum\nproduced by the NaI(Tl) detector.\nFor an ideal detector and supporting pulse processing elect ronics, the spectrum of 662-\nkeV gamma rays from a137Cs radioactive source would exhibit a peak in the spectrum\nwhose width is determined only by the natural variation in th e gamma-ray energy. The\nNaI(Tl) detector is far from ideal, and the width of the peak i t generates is typically 7%\nto 10% of the 662-keV gamma-ray energy. The major source of th is peak broadening is\nthe number of photoelectrons emitted from the photocathode for a 662-keV gamma-ray.\nStatistical ﬂuctuations in the secondary electron yield at the ﬁrst dynode and ﬂuctuations\nin the light collected from the scintillator also make a smal l contribution to broadening the\nwidth of the peak in the energy spectrum. Because the broaden ing is dominated by the\nnumber of photoelectrons, and that number is proportional t o the gamma-ray energy, the\nFWHM of a peak at energy E is approximately proportional to1√\nE\nBecause the scintillation has a 250-ns decay time constant, it is important to collect the\nresulting charge pulse from the photomultiplier tube for at least four time constants (i.e., 1\nµs). This collection time ensures that 98% of the light will con tribute to the analyzed pulse\nheight, thus assuring that the best possible energy resolut ion can be achieved. If a 0.5- µs\nshaping time constant is chosen on the linear ampliﬁer, the a mpliﬁer output pulse will reach\nits maximum amplitude in approximately 1.1 µs. Hence this is the minimum shaping time\nconstant that can be employed. If high counting rates are not expected, and the dead time\ncaused by the pulse width is not a problem, a 1- µsshaping time constant can be selected.\nThe latter choice delivers a pulse that reaches peak amplitu de in approximately 2.2 µs.\n7"

For the 0.5 µsshaping\ntime constant, the dead time amounts to about 5 µs, and for the 1 µstime constant, the dead\ntime is approximately 10 µs. Consequently, the NaI(Tl) system will experience a 10% dea d\ntime loss in the range of 10,000 to 20,000 counts/second, dep ending on the choice of ampliﬁer\nshaping time constant.

The an ode is held at the\nhighest potential and the cathode the lowest.\nPreampliﬁer :\nIn this case preampliﬁers most commonly used are emitter fol lowers or cathode followers.\nThese followers have high input impedance and low output imp edance. Such a unit is placed\nclose to the PMT. The PMT delivers output at a high impedance w hich needs to be fed to\nan emitter follower having an input impedance of a few mega oh ms. The output is taken via\na pulse transmission cable (characteristic impedance : 50 o r 100Ω) to the input of a linear\nampliﬁer.\nLinear ampliﬁer :\nThe linear ampliﬁer is used to amplify the pulses fed at its in put from the preampliﬁer. A\nlinear ampliﬁer is one which has a constant output to input am plitude ratio over a large\ndynamic range, say from > zero input pulse amplitude to a few v olts depending on the\nvoltage gain at which the ampliﬁer is being operated. The out put saturates at about 12V\nbeing safely linear up to 10V. If, for example, the gain is set at 100, the largest input pulse\namplitude up to which the output will remain linear is 10/100 = 0.1V.\n8"

Equation 1.7 indicates\nthat the percent energy resolution of the NaI(Tl) detector i mproves as the gamma-ray energy\nincreases.\n1.3.2 Photofraction :\nPhotofraction which is determined from the measured spectr um is deﬁned as :\nPhotofraction =(area under the full energy peak)\n(area under the total spectrum)(1.8)\nHere, “area” represents total number of counts which can be o btained by summing the counts\non Y-axis for a desired region of interest in the spectrum. It represents the fraction of the\nrecorded γ-ray intensity that is completely absorbed in the scintilla tor. This is an important\nquantity which is needed for evaluation of relative intensi ties ofγ-rays from a measured\ncomplex spectrum. When a spectrum is measured with a source th at emits γ-rays of more\nthan one energy the spectrum is found to consist more than one photopeak and a composite\nCompton continuum. The spectrum therefore assumes a comple x appearance. Photofraction\nis energy dependent and decreases as incident γ-ray energy increases.\n1.3.3 Detection eﬃciency :\nEﬃciency of a detector is limited due to its size and shape. Ch arged particles can be stopped\neasily in a detector of small active volume, whereas large vo lume of matter is required to\nstop uncharged particles like gamma rays and neutrons. Ther efore, a detector with limited\nsize does not have 100% eﬃciency.\nEﬃciency is classiﬁed into two parts; absolute and intrinsi c.

        "text": "1 Gamma-ray Scintillation Spectrometry\nRelevant information\nThe photopeak is created when the gamma-ray photon interact s in the scintillator via the\nphotoelectric eﬀect. The photon encounters an orbital elec tron that is tightly bound to a\nnucleus. The entire energy of the photon is transferred to th e electron, causing the electron\nto escape from the atom. The gamma-ray photon disappears in t he process. As the photo-\nelectron travels through the scintillator, it loses its ene rgy by causing additional ionization.\nAt the end of the process, the number of ionized atoms is propo rtional to the original en-\nergy of the photon. As the electrons re-ﬁll the vacancies in t he ionized atoms, visible light\nphotons are generated. This is the source of the scintillati on, wherein the number of visible\nphotons is proportional to the original energy of the gamma- ray. Consequently, the event\npopulates the photopeak in the spectrum. This peak is often c alled the full-energy peak,\nbecause a two-step interaction, a Compton scattering follo wed by a photoelectric interaction,\nalso contributes a small number of events to the full-energy peak.\nThe Compton interaction is a pure, kinematic collision betw een a gamma-ray photon and\nwhat might be termed a free electron in the NaI(Tl) crystal. B y this process, the incident\ngamma-ray photon gives up only part of its energy to the elect ron as it bounces oﬀ the free\nelectron. The recoiling electron loses energy by causing io nization as it travels through the\ncrystal. Thus the number of visible photons in the resulting scintillation is proportional\nto the recoil energy of the Compton electron. The amount of en ergy transferred from the\ngamma-ray photon to the recoiling electron depends on wheth er the collision is head-on or\nglancing. For a head-on collision, the gamma ray transfers t he maximum allowable energy\nfor the Compton interaction. Although it involves a photon a nd an electron, the interaction\nis similar to a billiard-ball collision. The reduced energy of the scattered gamma ray can be\ndetermined by solving the energy and momentum conservation equations for the collision.\nThe solution for these equations in terms of the scattered ga mma-ray energy can be written\nas\nEγ′=Eγ\n1+Eγ\nm0c2(1−cosθ)(1.13)\nwhereEγ′is the energy of the scattered photon γ′,θis the scattering angle for the direction\nofγ′relative to the direction of the incident gamma-ray, γ,Eγis the energy of the incident\nphotonγandm0c2is the rest mass energy of the electron and is equal to 511 keV.\nFor a head-on collision, the gamma-ray is scattered backwar ds along its initial trajectory,\nandθ= 180◦. For this condition, the backscattered gamma-ray energy be comes\nEγ′=Eγ\n1+2Eγ\nm0c2(1.14)\nIf this backscatter event happens in the detector, the maxim um energy transferred to the\nrecoiling electron will be\nEe=Eγ−Eγ′ (1.15)\n20"

This deﬁnes\nthe energy of the Compton edge in Figures 1.5 and 1.6. For an in itial gamma-ray energy of\n1 MeV, the above equations predict that the Compton edge will occur at ∼0.80MeV, and\nthe energy of the backscattered gamma ray will be ∼0.20MeV.\nBecause the gamma-ray photon can be scattered through any an gle from 0 to 180◦, and\nthe scattered photon can escape the detector, the energy dep osited in the detector can vary\nfrom the maximum at the Compton edge through all values down t o zero. This is the genesis\nof the Compton continuum in Figures 1.5 and 1.6. Note that the re is a small, but ﬁnite,\nprobability that the Compton scattered photon will be subse quently absorbed in the crystal\nby the photoelectric process. This two-step interaction wi ll generate a pulse that falls in the\nfull-energy peak.\nThe backscatter peak in Figures 1.5 and 1.6 is caused by Compt on scattering from an\nentirely diﬀerent location. Consider a gamma ray emitted by the radioactive source in a\ndirection heading away from the detector. This gamma ray can encounter material in the\nneighborhood of the radioactive source and undergo Compton scattering. If the scattering\nangle is 180◦the scattered gamma ray travels back towards the detector wi th an energy\ndeﬁned by equation 1.14. If this lower-energy gamma ray inte racts in the scintillator by the\nphotoelectric eﬀect, it will contribute to a photopeak at th e lower energy. Typically this\nbackscatter peak will be of low intensity, if there is minima l material behind the radioactive\nsource. Usually, the backscatter peak is rather broad, beca use of the range of directions\nthat can contribute to the peak. For an initial gamma-ray ene rgy of 1 MeV, equation 1.14\npredicts that the backscatter peak will occur at 0.20 MeV.\nTable 1.6: Determination of Compton edge and Backscattered peak\nSource Back-scattered Using Compton Compton edge Using Compton\npeak (keV) formula (keV) edge (keV) formula (keV)\nMethodology\n1.

Also, detectors are not 10 0% eﬃcient, i.e. all the radiations\nincident on the detector are not detected by the detector due to their limited size and the\ntype of material used as detector medium. Therefore, we need to determine eﬃciency of the\ndetector which will be used for the measurement of activity.\nAbsolute photopeak eﬃciency of a detector can be measured by taking a ratio of the number\nof photons contributing to photopeak and the number of photo ns emitted by the source.

Higher energy spectrum is\nmagniﬁed by a factor 10.\nYou need to identify the photopeaks in Eu spectrum. The easie st way to achieve this\nis to look for the last peak (1408 keV) and then move towards lo wer energy side. You\nwill ﬁnd four close lying peaks as 1408, (1112,1085), 964 and 779 keV (see Fig. 1.14).\nThe energy peaks (1112,1085) are not resolved by the detecto r. After a gap you will\nﬁnd 344, a small peak of 244 and a intense peak of 122 keV. X-ray peaks are visible at\nfurther lower energy.\n5. Calculate centroids and area of the peaks using ROI tools o f the spectrum analysis\nprogram and tabulate them in Table 1.10.\n6. Calculate present activity of the source.
